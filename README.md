# Welcome to SourceMind!ðŸ¤–
This is a very simple project built in a team of 5 in an AI camp to have a hands on experience. *Basically a wrapper* <br>
It's a project where user provide PDF files and URLs and asks questions and get answers from the AI!
<br>

## Methods/Tools
Initially built on paid OpenAI APIs, and now we're utilizing open-source model from HuggingFace!
More specifically, <a href='https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B'>Qwen3 model!</a>ðŸ¤“ <br>
A simple RAG model was also built to retrieve URL / PDF contents from user.<br>

<br>
Currently, this project is actively being improve, due to the unsatifactory of performance when utilizing different models due to different structures.
